# dbd-wiki-scraper
Custom functions for Google Sheets to pull data from the Dead by Daylight Wiki. 

I built these for a friend who's very into DBD and Google Sheets. I've used Apps Script to make API calls before, but this was my first time parsing HTML with [Cheerio](https://github.com/tani/cheeriogs).


## Usage

Fills column with a list of killers' titles from the Wiki

```=currentPatch()```
